<p style="text-align: center; padding-top: 1em;">
If you want to awaken the consciousness of others<br />
then, raise your own and<br />
awaken the life within yourself<br />
<br />
If you want to be loved in a way<br />
no one has ever loved you<br />
then, unlatch the barriers with which you’ve guarded your heart<br />
and be that L O V E yourself<br />
<br />
If you want to live your dream<br />
and detach from the fear that binds you<br />
then, close your eyes<br />
take a deep breath and J U M P<br />
<br />
If you want to eliminate the suffering around<br />
and within you<br />
then, muzzle the darkness and allow the Light<br />
to penetrate through you<br />
<br />
If you want to find your voice<br />
and can’t quite hear it<br />
then, mute the noise and L I S T E N<br />
until you’ve filled the silence<br />
<br />
If you are on the brink<br />
and the boundaries are dissipating before you<br />
then, Open your eyes<br />
Walk toward the brightness and<br />
Be the Transformation yourself.<br />

    "Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you've never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that may never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can't wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that might seem insignificant to others such as a note, a song or a walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. A phone call or text message during the day helps to get you through a long day's work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there's no need for continuous conversation, but you find you're quite content in just having them nearby. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a blue sky, a gentle wind or a sunset on the horizon. You open your heart and doing so, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems exciting and worthwhile. Your hope and security is in knowing that they are now part of your life." &mdash;&nbsp;Bob&nbsp;Marley&nbsp;(&nbsp;adapted).

These are some of the most active geo-thermals on the planet. The geyser on the
center (Lady Knox) is the tallest in southern hemisphere. Oh there was a
beautiful rainbow while it was irrupting. How temperamental, intriguing, and
wonderful at the same time. In the evening, we had dinner at Te Puia Maori
village. Meals were cooked by keeping under the volcanic rocks.</p>

<b>Roads Go Ever On</b><br />
<br />
Roads go ever ever on,<br />
Over rock and under tree,<br />
By caves where never sun has shone,<br />
By streams that never find the sea;<br />
Over snow by winter sown,<br />
And through the merry flowers of June,<br />
Over grass and over stone,<br />
And under mountains in the moon.<br />
<br />
Roads go ever ever on,<br />
Under cloud and under star.<br />
Yet feet that wandering have gone<br />
Turn at last to home afar.<br />
Eyes that fire and sword have seen,<br />
And horror in the halls of stone<br />
Look at last on meadows green,<br />
And trees and hills they long have known.<br />
<br />
The Road goes ever on and on<br />
Down from the door where it began.<br />
Now far ahead the Road has gone,<br />
And I must follow, if I can,<br />
Pursuing it with eager feet,<br />
Until it joins some larger way,<br />
Where many paths and errands meet.<br />
And whither then? I cannot say.<br />
<br />
The Road goes ever on and on<br />
Out from the door where it began.<br />
Now far ahead the Road has gone.<br />
Let others follow, if they can!<br />
Let them a journey new begin.<br />
But I at last with weary feet<br />
Will turn towards the lighted inn,<br />
My evening-rest and sleep to meet.<br />

  Huka falls, Taupō, New Zealand.
</div>

<p>Perhaps, you have heard about how kind the Kiwis are. Here is one of my first
hand experiences. We spend this morning in Craters of Moon National Park. Later
we planned to walk from there to Huka falls. The weather was really volatile.
When we were about to leave the park, it started pouring. So we decided to call
a taxi from the city. While we were waiting, a park employee came to us and
asked where we were heading. He told he finished his shift and going back to the
city, so if we want he can give us a ride. We said but we are going to another
point, he said that is fine, he would drop us there. But we confirmed the taxi,
and the driver perhaps already left from the city. He insisted it is absolutely
fine to cancel. We called back to cancel, nobody argued or asked for penalty :P
So we got on his car, he told us some stories along the way. He dropped us,
wished good luck, and we could never thank him enough.</p>

<p>Waiheke is about one hour by boat from Auckland Central. The ferry arrives at
Matiatia Wharf. Then intra-island busses can be used to move around or just
walk. You have to plan which points you are going to cover; seeing each and
every corner is not feasible in a single day. There are several beaches,
beautiful Oneroa is one of them.</p>

<p>Pulau Ubin is northeast of mainland Singapore. We took a morning ferry from
Changi Ferry Terminal. Got to the island and rented bikes to move around the
island. There are restaurants, no need to worry about survival. The island is
big enough to spend a whole day. Tropical forest, mangroves, coconut trees, some
sand beaches, small lakes. There are some watchtowers for panoramic views.
Depending on the timing, you might be able to see some beautiful coral reefs.
If it is high-tide, they might be underwater. Birds, monkeys, crabs, lizards and
mosquitoes all around. Don’t forget to bring insect repellant and wear full
sleeve. It also lines up with one of Changi landing runway, you will see
airplanes descending very low every couple of minutes.</p>
